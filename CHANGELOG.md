# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [3.0.0.dev1] - Unreleased (гілка v3)

### Changed — package restructure (step 1 of the 3.0 packaging track)
- All code moved under a single top-level package **`datamasking`**:
  `masking/` → `datamasking/masking/`, `unmasking/` → `datamasking/unmasking/`,
  `modules/` → `datamasking/extras/`, `rank_data.py` → `datamasking/rank_data.py`.
  This removes the generic top-level names (`modules`, `rank_data`) that would
  collide in site-packages once the project is pip-installable.
- New module entry point: `python -m datamasking mask|unmask|--version`
  (the old `python . mask` still works).

### Backward compatibility
- Root shims keep every historical import path working with a
  `DeprecationWarning`: `import masking`, `import unmasking`,
  `from modules.tools import …`, `from rank_data import …`. Shims alias
  `sys.modules` so old and new paths share a single module instance
  (live `MASK_*` flags keep one state).
- `data_masking.py` / `unmask_data.py` remain supported entry scripts
  (unchanged CLI), now re-exporting from `datamasking.*`.

### Fixed
- `check_mapping_version` treated any mapping version not starting with
  "2." as v1 logic — mapping files written by 3.x would silently be
  unmasked with the v1 path. Now the major/minor are parsed properly:
  2.0→v2.0, 2.1+→v2.1, 3.x+→v2.1 (mapping format unchanged since 2.1).
  Same fix applied to schema validation in `unmasking/io.py`.

### Not in this step (deliberately)
- `pyproject.toml`, console-script entry points, PyInstaller/release
  pipeline changes and docs rewrite — next steps of the 3.0 track;
  `release.yml` is untouched and still builds from the root scripts.

## [2.6.10] - 2026-07

### Removed
- Rank **«рекрут»** removed from all rank lists: `RANK_DECLENSIONS`,
  `ARMY_RANKS` (rank_data.py), army regex in `RANK_PATTERNS`
  (masking/constants.py) and its copy in `modules/tools.py`, plus README
  rank tables and examples. The rank is no longer recognized in text and
  is never produced as a mask.

### Note
- Removing «рекрут» from the army hierarchy shifts deterministic mask
  choices for adjacent low ranks — the same input text may now mask ranks
  differently than in ≤2.6.9. Unmasking of old files is unaffected:
  it uses the mapping JSON, not the hierarchy.

## [2.6.9] - 2026-07

### Fixed
- Official letter openings are no longer masked as PIB:
  `Повідомляємо Вам, що …` was treated as "Surname Name". Words with
  1st/2nd-person-plural verb endings (`-ємо`, `-имо`, `-емо`, `-єте`,
  `-ите`, `-ете`) are rejected as name candidates; pronouns
  `Вам/Вами/Ваш(-а/-е)` and common verbs (`Повідомляємо`, `Просимо`,
  `Направляємо`, `Надаємо`) added to `EXCLUDE_WORDS`. Real PIB after such
  phrases is still masked.

## [2.6.8] - 2026-07

### Added
- **Standalone ranks in quotes are now masked.** A rank wrapped in quotes as
  a value on its own — `«молодший сержант»`, `звання «капітан» присвоєно`,
  or log lines `… → «молодший сержант» …` — is masked even without an
  accompanying PIB. Only exact known rank forms (`ALL_RANK_FORMS`) inside the
  quotes are touched; arbitrary quoted text (`«важливо»`, `«138»`) is left
  alone. Quotes stay in place; unmask restores via the `rank` mapping.

### Known limitation
- If a masked rank happens to collide with a *different, unmasked* bare rank
  elsewhere in the same line (e.g. `капітан «майор»` where `майор` masks to
  `капітан`), roundtrip may be ambiguous — an inherent property of
  deterministic masking on collisions, not specific to quotes. Realistic
  formats (one quoted rank, or several distinct quoted ranks) round-trip
  correctly.

## [2.6.7] - 2026-07

### Fixed
- **PIB preceded by service labels / noise is now masked.** In lines like
  `ПІБ: Петренко Іван Васильович` or log lines
  `… ІПН=3698521592 — ПІБ «138» → «Міронов Андрій Петрович» …` the real name
  was skipped: the PIB anchor latched onto `ІПН=…` (starts uppercase) or the
  marker `ПІБ`, then stopped. Now `is_pib_anchor` strips trailing punctuation
  and rejects tokens containing digits/`=`; `ПІБ` and `звання` are excluded
  markers.

### Known limitation
- A bare rank with **no** following PIB (e.g. `звання «…» → «молодший сержант»`)
  is still not masked — long-standing behavior that avoids false positives on
  rank words in prose; independent of this fix.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- **Quoted values are now masked.** Names, rank+PIB and IPNs wrapped in quotes
  (`«…»`, `"…"`, `„…“`) were skipped because words stuck to the quote chars
  (`«Петренко`, `сержант»`) and only `,.!?;:` was stripped. Quotes are now
  stripped in recognition (`looks_like_name`, `is_pib_anchor`,
  `is_likely_surname_by_case`, PIB/rank token extraction) and normalized to
  spaces in `normalize_string`. Quotes stay in place; roundtrip preserved.
  Note: a bare rank without a following PIB is still not masked (unchanged
  behavior, independent of quotes).

## [2.6.5] - 2026-06

### Changed
- The combined-unmask-regex fallback (v2.6.4) now logs a `WARNING` when the
  alternation regex fails to compile, instead of silently switching to the
  slow per-mask path

## [2.6.4] - 2026-06

### Performance
- Unmask of non-rank data is now a single alternation-regex pass instead of
  one full-text scan per mask — ~10× faster on large documents
  (278 KB: ~30 s → ~2.8 s). Longer masks take priority over substrings;
  per-mask occurrence counter keeps instance tracking exact. Slow per-mask
  path kept as fallback for masks that break regex compilation

## [2.6.3] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- Lettered sub-items no longer masked as initials: `п. В. Петренко` (item B),
  `ст. А. Кодексу`, `абз. Б. …` etc. — when a service abbreviation
  (`п.`, `пп.`, `ч.`, `ст.`, `абз.`, `гл.`, `розд.`, …) directly precedes an
  initials+surname pattern, the leading letter is treated as a clause marker,
  not a name

## [2.6.2] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- Windows: close log file handlers before `os.unlink()` in tests
  (`PermissionError: [WinError 32]` from held file locks)

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06

### Changed
- `docs/README.md` translated to English; Ukrainian original moved to
  `docs/README_UK.md`; both cross-linked

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06

Release rollup of 2.5.2–2.5.8 (reversible initials, instance tracking fixes,
live `MASK_*` flags, O(n) replacements, threat model docs, stderr passwords).

### Changed
- Version strings synchronized across all file headers (were stuck at 2.5.1)
- Historical "extracted during vX refactoring" phrases pinned to v2.5.0
  so they no longer drift with version bumps

## [2.5.8] - 2026-06

### Performance
- Replacement loops (mask engine, initials phase, both unmask passes) build
  the result via segment join instead of rebuilding the whole string per
  replacement — O(n) instead of O(n²) on large documents

### Fixed
- Mask engine processes items in document order: instance numbers now match
  occurrence order (was reverse — wrong original could be restored when two
  different values masked to the same string)

## [2.5.7] - 2026-06

### Security
- Generated encryption passwords are printed to **stderr** (not stdout) with
  a "shown once" warning — keeps them out of redirected output, pipes and
  CI logs

## [2.5.6] - 2026-06

### Changed
- README updated for the package architecture (`masking/`, `unmasking/`,
  `__main__.py`), initials masking documented
- README: new "Модель загроз та обмеження" section — honest statement that
  this is pseudonymization (partial digit/letter preservation, deterministic
  unsalted hashing, rank shift ±1-2, date shift ±30 days)
- Wrapper docstrings: corrected `python -m` mention (actual invocation is
  `python . mask` / `python . unmask` from the repo root)

## [2.5.5] - 2026-06

### Changed
- `modules/rank_data.py` is now a re-export of the root `rank_data.py`
  (was a full 636-line copy that could silently diverge)

## [2.5.4] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- `data_masking.MASK_*`, `DEBUG_MODE`, `PRESERVE_CASE`, `HASH_ALGORITHM` are
  live again: reads and writes through the wrapper delegate to
  `masking.constants` (after the v2.5.0 refactoring writes were silently
  ignored — broken backward compatibility)

### Changed
- Removed unused imports in `masking/cli.py` (`SelectiveFilter`,
  `apply_filter_to_globals`, `ReMasker`)

## [2.5.3] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- Repeated text dates (`06 жовтня 2025 року` twice in a document) now track
  instances `[1, 2, ...]` — previously only the first occurrence was restored
  by unmask
- Text date masking inside the engine is now deterministic (the internal copy
  of the function never seeded the RNG)

### Changed
- Removed duplicated `_mask_date_text` implementation (~50 lines);
  it is now an alias of `mask_date_text`

## [2.5.2] - 2026-06

### Fixed
- **Initials are now reversible**: masked initials (`Іванов П.А.` etc.) are stored
  in the mapping under new `initials` category — unmask restores them
- Initials regexes no longer match across line breaks (`П.А.\nСлово` false positive)
- Main PIB parser no longer re-masks surnames already masked by the initials
  phase (nested masks broke unmask)
- Initials mapping is written in document order — instance tracking stays
  consistent with occurrence order

### Added
- `tests/test_initials.py` — 27 tests covering all formats and mask→unmask roundtrip
- Version asserts in tests are now dynamic (compare against `masking.constants`)

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04

### Fixed
- Unmask broken for v2.3+ mappings (`check_mapping_version` fell through to v1 logic)
- `_mask_initial` now uses surname as seed context (different PIBs produce different initials)
- `_UA_UPPER` completed with missing letters (Ї, Є, Ґ, Щ, Ч, Ш, Й)

### Changed
- Performance: `EXCLUDE_WORDS` and `RANKS_LIST` cached as `frozenset` for O(1) lookups
- Performance: `normalize_broken_ranks` regex compiled once (lazy cached)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04

### Changed
- **Refactoring**: split `data_masking.py` (2654 lines) into `masking/` package with 8 modules:
  `constants`, `helpers`, `language`, `context`, `mask_personal`, `mask_military`, `engine`, `cli`
- **Refactoring**: split `unmask_data.py` (1369 lines) into `unmasking/` package with 4 modules:
  `helpers`, `engine`, `io`, `cli`
- Root-level `data_masking.py` and `unmask_data.py` are now thin wrappers with full backward compatibility

### Added
- `__main__.py` — run as `python . mask [args]` or `python . unmask [args]`
- `masking/` package — modular masking implementation
- `unmasking/` package — modular unmasking implementation
- PIB masking with initials: `Іванов П.А.`, `П. Агранов`, `К.П. Іванов`, `Т. А. Сидоренко`, `КОВАЛЕНКО І.В.`

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04

### Fixed
- Rank and PIB masking in lines with section numbering (e.g. `20.1.2.1.`)
- Trailing punctuation (`,`) preserved when extracting PIB words
- CI: release workflow handles existing releases (create or upload)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03

### Fixed
- Unicode output crash on Windows (PyInstaller cp1252 encoding issue)
- Replaced Cyrillic text in argparse help with English for cross-platform compatibility
- Added PyInstaller runtime hook to force UTF-8 on Windows

### Changed
- CI: replaced softprops/action-gh-release with `gh` CLI
